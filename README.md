# Analysis of COVID-19 cases and lockdowns in Australia 
This is a project by Group 28 that analyse the Covid-19 cases and lockdowns in Australia.

# Summary
The purpose of this project is to observe COVID-19 cases within Australia and how they affect
lockdowns within each state.

The dataset that we will be using was obtained from M3ITâ€™s COVID-19_Data repository on
GitHub. We are using the data created on 30/9/2021.

We will be also creating our own dataset on when lockdown occured. We used various articles and blogs to determine when lockdown occured and till when they were eased.

This project contains the use of various techniques to express our analysis including:
K-nearest neighbour to predict the daily cases and when in lockdown
Logistic regression to predict the daily cases and when in lockdown
Linear regression to predict the daily cases and when in lockdown
